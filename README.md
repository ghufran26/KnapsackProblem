# KnapsackProblem
In combination optimization, the knapsack problem is one problem: Determines the number of objects to be collected, each with a weight and value, so that the total weight is less or the same as a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. The number of the items should be determined. Its name derives from the problem of someone who has a fixed-size knapsackÂ and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in the allocation of resources where decision making people must choose between a range of projects or tasks, which are not divisible and are subject to a fixed budget or time limit.
